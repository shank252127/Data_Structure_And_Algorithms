One of the most important applications of stacks is to check 
if the parentheses are balanced in a given expression. 
The compiler generates an error if the parentheses are not matched.



Consider the above mentioned unbalanced expressions:



1.The expression ( a + b is unbalanced as there is no closing parenthesis given.
2.The expression [ ( c - d * e ] is unbalanced as the closed round parenthesis is not given.
3.The expression { [ ( ] ) } is unbalanced as the nesting of square parenthesis and the round parenthesis are incorrect.
4.The expression ( a + b ) is balanced as there is closing parenthesis given for all opening parenthesis .
